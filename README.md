A Web App to predict the price of a car based on its features.

App is deployed in Streamlit, hit the link to access it : [Open in Streamlit](https://carpriceprediction-xu5bjt4kticbrrwce6hnut.streamlit.app/) 


## Summary

A non-U.S. automotive corporation is poised to establish a production presence within the United States to offer competitive options against established U.S. and European automobile manufacturers.

Engaging the expertise of an automotive consultancy, the corporation seeks a detailed analysis of determinants influencing automobile pricing within the U.S. marketâ€”a market which presents distinct variances from the Chinese sector. The firm aims to delineate:
- The critical predictors influencing U.S. car prices and the extent of their impact.
- The relationship between these predictors and the vehicle pricing structure.

Armed with comprehensive market research data spanning various car categories within the American landscape, the consultancy is tasked with developing a predictive model for car pricing based on a suite of independent variables. This model will serve as an analytical tool for the company's leadership to navigate the complexities of price setting. It will inform strategic decisions regarding car design and business approaches to align with specific pricing tiers. Additionally, this predictive model will act as a foundational framework for the company to assimilate the dynamics of a new market's pricing structure.
